# Uplift

# Backend

## Quick start

Run `docker-compose up --build` to build the application, and run `docker-compose up -d` to start the application. Any modifications to rust code will require a rebuild.
You can run `docker-compose stop` to stop the containers and `docker-compose down` to delete the containers. In most cases, you are looking to stop the containers.
